	</div>

	<div>
		<h3>How did we find it</h3>
		<p>It's the website from a guy Frederik connected with on Linkedin</p>
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://brand.linkedin.com/etc/designs/linkedin/katy/global/clientlibs/img/default-share.png" alt="Linkedin logo"></a>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3>Why should it be updated</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>He uses this website to sell things but the webshop is not easy to find</li>
			<li>He focuses more on news about the products instead of selling it in an easy way</li>
			<li>It doesn't help that the website doesn't have a clear structure. That way it doesn't really invite you to read about the products</li>
			<li>Users don't really know what the site is trying to do when you visit it for the first time</li>
			<li>The website looks like a scam instead of a legit webshop</li>
		</ul>
